            <h2>Harnessing Community Light to End Water Waste</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Aquanour, where water (Aqua) meets light (Nour). In a land where every drop is precious, our mission is to illuminate and eliminate water waste across Morocco by empowering our most valuable resource: our communities. We've built a simple, powerful system that transforms your phone into a tool for conservation. With just a single text message, you can instantly report a water leak, pinpointing the problem for a faster repair. Your alert doesn't just get logged; it helps safeguard the water that sustains our homes, our farms, and our future. Together, we can create a network of vigilance and turn a small action into a wave of positive change.</p>
